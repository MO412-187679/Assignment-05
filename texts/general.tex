\subsection*{General Solution}

    As described earlier, any solution to the original equation can now be achieved by adding some homogeneous solution to our particular solution, resulting in:
    \begin{align}
        f(x) &= A e^{-2x} + \frac{1}{2} x - \frac{1}{4} \nonumber\\
        &= \frac{B e^{-2x} + 2x - 1}{4} \label{eq:general}
    \end{align}

    For some other $B \in \real$.
